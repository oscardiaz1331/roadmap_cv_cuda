## CUDA-Centric Capabilities

### 1. CUDA Cores and SMs

* **4864 CUDA cores** are distributed across **38 SMs**, meaning each SM contains 128 CUDA cores.
* Each SM executes **warps** of 32 threads. Warps are the basic scheduling units in CUDA.

### 2. Warp Scheduling

* Each SM has multiple warp schedulers capable of issuing multiple instructions per cycle.
* Improved instruction throughput compared to Turing GPUs.

### 3. Tensor Cores

* Ampere introduces **third-generation Tensor Cores**, optimized for mixed-precision (FP16, BF16, TF32) operations.
* Highly beneficial for AI and scientific computing workloads.

### 4. Ray Tracing Cores

* The RTX 3060 Ti includes dedicated **second-generation ray tracing cores**.
* These can be used in CUDA for rendering-related and BVH-accelerated intersection tests.

### 5. Memory Bandwidth and Throughput

* With **448 GB/s bandwidth**, the card can handle large data transfers efficiently.
* Shared memory and cache hierarchies improve data locality and reduce global memory bottlenecks.

### 6. Compute Capability

* The RTX 3060 Ti has **Compute Capability 8.6**, enabling access to:

  * Cooperative groups
  * Asynchronous data copy to shared memory
  * Improved atomic operations
  * Support for new warp-level primitives

---

## Practical Implications

* **Shared Memory per SM:** \~100 KB configurable between L1 and shared memory.
* **Threads per SM:** Up to 2048 resident threads.
* **Blocks per SM:** Typically up to 32 resident blocks, depending on resource usage.

## Summary

The RTX 3060 Ti is well-suited for CUDA development, offering a balanced set of cores, memory bandwidth, and SM resources. With Compute Capability 8.6, it supports modern CUDA features and optimizations. Understanding its layout helps in writing efficient GPU code that utilizes memory hierarchies and parallel execution patterns effectively.
